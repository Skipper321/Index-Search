# cs121-projects
A repository for CS121 projects

## General notes
From Julie minhab@uci.edu

`tokenizer.py` - this is copied from previous files

`unzip.py` - this unzips your file with the usage format: `python -u parse.py [filename.zip here]`

`file_items` - treats each file as an item, handles json within the file itself

Note: my .gitignore includes `analyst.zip` and `developer.zip` because we already have access to these files. Github won't let me unzip 1000+ changes from the folder when you unzip so you'll have to run the command yourself.

## TODO: 

`file_items.py`: 
`def parse_contents` needs writing

`tokenizer.py`: needs to be rewritten for this project
